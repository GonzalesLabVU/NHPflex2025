# Probe and PCB Fabrication

This folder contains links, step-by-step instructions, and vendor information for fabricating the flexible neural probes and associated electronics.

## Overview

Fabrication involves two main components:
1. **Neural probes**: custom flexible electrodes
2. **PCBs**: supporting electronics for signal conditioning and acquisition

## Fabrication Process and Vendors

See the main repository `README.md` for the link to the fabrication service and detailed process documentation.
