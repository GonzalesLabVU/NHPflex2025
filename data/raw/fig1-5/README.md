# Raw Data for Figures 1–5

This folder contains the raw and preprocessed datasets used to generate Figures 1–5 in the main manuscript.

## File Organization

Subdirectories or files may be organized by figure number or experiment type. Each dataset should include:
- Raw recording data (`.mat`, `.bin`, or other formats as applicable)
- Preprocessed intermediate files (filtered, drift-corrected, spike-sorted)
- Associated metadata files describing recording parameters, animal ID, session date, etc.

## Data Access
