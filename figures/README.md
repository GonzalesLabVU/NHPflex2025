# Reconstructed Figures

This folder contains the final figure images generated by the analysis scripts in `matlab/figures/`.

## Contents

- **Main figures**: PNG or PDF images of Figures 1–5 from the manuscript
- **Supplementary figures**: images for Supplementary Figures 1–5
- **Figure panels**: individual subpanels or variants as needed

## File Organization

Figures are typically organized as:
- `figure_1.png`, `figure_1.pdf` (or similar naming)
- `figure_2.png`, etc.
- `supp_figure_1.png`, etc.

## Generation

These figures are regenerated automatically by running the corresponding scripts in `matlab/figures/figX/run_figureX.m`. To reproduce:

```matlab
cd matlab/figures/fig1
run('run_figure1.m')
% Output figures saved to figures/
```

## Use in Manuscript

Figures in this folder are publication-ready (or nearly so) and can be used directly in the manuscript or presentation materials, subject to resolution and formatting requirements.

## Notes

- High-resolution versions (300+ DPI) should be used for print publications
- Check individual figure scripts for export settings and resolution parameters
- If modifying figure aesthetics, update the corresponding generation script in `matlab/figures/`

## Questions?

See the figure-specific `README.md` files in `matlab/figures/figX/` for detailed descriptions and methodology.
