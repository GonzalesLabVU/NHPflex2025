# Reconstructed Figures

This folder contains the final figure images generated by the analysis scripts in `matlab/figures/`.


## Generation

These figures are regenerated automatically by running the corresponding scripts in `matlab/figures/figX/run_figureX.m`. To reproduce:

```matlab
cd matlab/figures/fig1
run('run_figure1.m')
% Output figures saved to figures/
```
