# 3D Design Files

This folder contains STL and STEP design files for the microdrive adapter used to mount flexible neural probes to standard electrophysiology rigs.

## Microdrive Adapter

The 3D-printed adapter is designed to integrate flexible probes with the [Narishige MO-97A hydraulic micromanipulator](https://narishige.co.jp/en/products/micromanipulators/mo97a/). This adapter enables precise positioning and stabilization of the flexible probes during recording sessions in non-human primate experiments.
