# Probe Fabrication Files

This folder contains design files, masks, and CAD layouts used for probe fabrication.

## Contents

- **CAD files**: SolidWorks, FreeCAD, or other CAD formats (`.step`, `.stp`, `.dwg`, `.dxf`, etc.) defining probe geometry.
- **Masks**: Photolithography masks or pattern files for microfabrication steps.
- **Fabrication notes**: Documentation of materials, process steps, and vendor specifications.

## Probe Design Overview

Flexible neural probes were designed to enable chronic multi-site recordings in non-human primates. For detailed information on probe specifications, materials, and design considerations, see the `fabrication/README.md` and the main repository `README.md`.

## Design Modifications

If you intend to modify probe designs, ensure that:
- Critical dimensions (e.g., electrode spacing, tip geometry) are preserved or clearly documented.
- Any changes are validated through simulation or prototype testing before fabrication.

## Questions?

Contact the authors for design details, fabrication recommendations, or inquiries about probe customization.
